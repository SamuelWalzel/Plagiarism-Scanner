# Step-by-Step Approach

    ## Text Preprocessing:
        Tokenization: Break each text into smaller parts (tokens), such as words or sentences. This helps in comparing individual components of the text.
        Stopword Removal: Remove common words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that don't contribute much meaning but may interfere with meaningful comparison.
        Stemming/Lemmatization: Reduce words to their root forms (e.g., "running" becomes "run") to normalize variations in word usage.
        Lowercase Transformation: Convert the text to lowercase to ensure that case differences don't affect the comparison.

    ## Text Similarity Measurement: To determine the similarity between two texts, various methods can be applied. Here are a few options:
        Cosine Similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space (each word can be represented as a dimension). This is commonly used for comparing the frequency of words in the two texts.
            First, convert the text into a vector (usually through a TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or Bag of Words (BoW) model).
            Then, calculate the cosine similarity between the two vectors.
        Jaccard Similarity: Measures the similarity between two sets by dividing the size of the intersection by the size of the union of the sets.
            For example, you can treat the texts as sets of words and calculate the ratio of common words to total unique words.
        Word Moverâ€™s Distance (WMD): This method calculates the minimum distance words need to travel to match the words in another document. This method is good for paraphrasing detection because it accounts for semantic similarity.

    ## Advanced Semantic Comparison:

        Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe, etc.): Convert words into vectors in a high-dimensional space where semantically similar words are close to each other. By comparing word embeddings for both texts, you can detect more nuanced similarities, such as paraphrasing or synonym usage.

        Sentence Embeddings: Using models like BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), RoBERTa, or Sentence-BERT to represent entire sentences or texts as vectors. These models capture deep semantic meaning and context, which helps in detecting paraphrasing that other methods might miss.

    ## Plagiarism Detection Techniques:
        Fingerprinting: Generate unique "fingerprints" for text chunks, which could be based on sequences of words or n-grams. You compare these fingerprints between documents to identify similarity.
        Paraphrase Detection: Use semantic analysis to detect whether one text is simply a paraphrase of another. This is harder than direct word matching but is a critical aspect of detecting plagiarism.

    ## Threshold for Plagiarism:
        Set a threshold for similarity. If the similarity score between two texts is above a certain threshold (e.g., 70% or higher), then you can flag the texts as potentially plagiarized.
        Consider additional rules for context: for example, if both texts are on the same topic and share a high degree of similarity, this might be an indicator of plagiarism, even if the texts are not identical.
